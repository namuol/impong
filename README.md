ImpactJS Starter Template
-------------------------

This is my starter template for ImpactJS games.

I like to use CoffeeScript, so this essentially is just the skeleton and build script I need to get started.

The ImpactJS libraries are not included, for obvious reasons, but the contents of the impact directory should be put into the "build" directory.
